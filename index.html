			Here at Grant we sell top quality citrus fruits and marmalades.  Only the finest fruits are fetched for our four flavors of fresh spreads.  In this hour-long lesson, we'll teach you what it takes to become a master fruit-boy.

			<p>
			We also offer lessons regarding citrus garnish.  It takes a delicate touch to arrange a bunch of oranges and lemons on a plate the right way, and while you'll probably suck at it in the beginning, we'll spend an hour getting all the suck out of your work that we can.

			This all probably seems a little strange, huh?  Paying to have some dude talk to you about citrus... that'd be way better if you weren't sober.  Well you're in luck!  For an extra $15, we'll get you white girl wasted before any of our lessons!

		<h1>About the Company</h1>
		<p>Grant was formed in 2016 by self-proclaimed citrus guru, Spence Hood.  Growing up in the slums of Narnia, his parents worked tirelessly to feed him as a boy.  Often he would eat only oranges and lemons for every meal of the day, as those could be picked freely from the trees in his backyard.  Spence, in his teen years, discovered planking, YOLO, and Zumba, and realized he could contribute more to the world than his millennial counterparts.  From that day forth, he made it his life's mission to teach the world about the citrus-y goodness he knew so well.  Grant is now the industry-leader in zest-related products and services, consisting of 30 operational factories pumping out marmalades by the barrel, and an additional 1,200 retail stores across the nation.  Spence says he'd like to be buried in a pool of tangerine slices when he passes, and hopes to live to see the day that his grandchildren pucker in delight over their first grapefruit the way he did as a child.</p>
